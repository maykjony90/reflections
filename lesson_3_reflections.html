    <strong>Question: </strong><p>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?</p>
    <strong>Question: </strong><p>When I don't have my laptop for a while or when I have to change the devices constantly 
    while working on a project. Also, if there are several people working on the project. Being able to access your project from wherever
    you want is very handful.</p>
